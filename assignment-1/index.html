        <h2>Github Pages & HTML/CSS Basics Review</h2>
        <p>This week, we are going to focus on watching some pre-recorded content to review HTML, CSS and introduce <a
                href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github
                Pages</a>. </p>
        <p>You will also begin setting up your own Github Pages where this and future assignments will be submitted.</p>
        <p>We will be reviewing these concepts next week in class, so please watch all of the video content and do your
            best to finish the assignment, but we will also review together. </p>
        <p>Please at least set up your Github account, fill out the questionnaire locally, and do your
            best to get it uploaded to Github Pages. </p>
        <br />
        <p>This assignment will be due by <b>8:00 AM on February 4th</b>.</p>
        <p>Submit the link to your Github Page to the <b>#assignment-1</b> slack channel, or if you are unable to get it
            to work due to errors or other issue please submit your filled out copy of your local <u>index.html</u>
            Questionnaire file to <b>#assignment-1</b> channel.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Videos</h3>
        <p>These videos will provide a review of HTML and CSS basics, adding embedded content to your web pages, and
            finally an example of creating a Github page.</p>
        <p><b>Note: you do not need to follow any of the instructions for creating and styling pages in the 'Github
                Pages Demo'</b></p>
        <p>It is a good additional review of the concepts we will be exploring, but this week we are *only* working on
            our unstyled 'Questionnaire.'</p>
        <p>The password for all videos is <i>interaction</i>.</p>

            <figcaption>Root folder on desktop titled <u>ianglover.github.io</u>.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <p>For this class, we will want to create an organized and consistent folder structure.</p>
        <p>To begin with, we will create our <b>Root Folder</b>, where all of our future assignments and work for this
            class will live.
        </p>
        <p>First, create a new folder on your Desktop. The folders name will depend upon your <u>newschool.edu</u> email
            address.</p>
        <p>If your New School email address is <u>gloveri123@newschool.edu</u>, then your folder will be named
            <u>gloveri123.github.io</u>
        </p>
        <p>
            <br />
        <h3>Questionnaire</h3>

            <img src="./questionnaire.png"
                alt="File browser with folder titled 'example.github.io' with nested file 'index.html'"
                style="max-width: 800px;" />
            <figcaption>Finder window looking at Root Folder containing an 'index.html' file.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <p>Right-Click on the following link to download the "Questionnaire", and save it as <u>index.html</u> in your
            new <b>Root Folder</b>:</p>
        <a href="./questionnaire.html" target="_blank">Questionnaire Text</a>
        <p>Fill out the questionnaire locally using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">Visual Studio
                Code</a>, or your preferred Text Editor.</p>
        <p>To preview the page locally, double-click on <u>index.html</u> to open it in your browser. While working,
            simply refresh the page to see any changes.
        </p>
        </p>When you have completed the questionnaire, follow the next steps and the <a
            href="https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/507300649/74a702a16d" target="_blank">Github Pages Demo</a> to the
        best of your ability to upload it to your Github Page.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Github Pages</h3>
        <p>If you have not already, create an account at <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> using your New School
            email address.</p>
        <p>Your account name should be the first part of your New School email address.</p>
        <p>For example, if your New School email is <u>gloveri123@newschool.edu</u> then your account should be named
            <u>gloveri123</u>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>After you have created an account, download the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop</a>
            application.
        <p>Once downloaded, open the <b>Github Desktop</b> application and Log In using the credentials of the Github
            account you have just created.
        </p>
        <br />

            <figcaption>Settings for 'Name' and 'Local Path' options in Create a New Repository window</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <p>Give the repository the same <b>Name</b> as your <b>Root Folder</b>, for example <u>glover123.github.io</u>.
        </p>
        <p>In the same window, for <b>Local Path</b> press the <b>Choose...</b> button and find and select your <b>Root
                Folder</b></p>
        <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="./publish-repository.png" alt="Publish Repository information and button"

            <figcaption>'Publish Repository' information and button</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <p>Finally, in the next page you should see an option to <b>Publish Repository</b>, select this option and
            without changing any options in the window that opens, press <b>Publish Repository</b> again.
            <br />
