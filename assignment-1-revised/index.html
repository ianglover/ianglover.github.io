      <h1>Assignment #1 - Github Pages ( Review )</h1>
      <p>
        This week, our main goal is to create our 'Home Page' on Github Pages
        where we will be hosting our future work, projects, and personal
        information. We will also watch a video previewing what we will be
        working on next week in class: using CSS to work with
        <b>Typography on the Web</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would also advise reviewing videos from last week for when you are
        beginning to code your "Cross-Platform Storytelling" projects to refresh
        your memory on <b>HTML and CSS Basics</b>, <b>Embedded Content</b>, and
        <b>Github Pages</b>.
      </p>
      <h2>Due Next Week</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you need a refresher, review last weeks content</li>
        <li>
          Update File/Folder Organization for Organizing Studio Projects and Lab
          Workshops
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a 'Homepage' on Github with link to Questionnaire and
          "Cross-Platform Storytelling" Project
        </li>
        <li>Set up Github Pages to host your new 'Homepage'</li>
        <li>Watch <i>Typography on the Web</i></li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>Content to Review</h3>

      <h3>File Structure and Organization</h3>
      <p>
        If you made it far enough last week to create a Github account or a
        Github Pages site, you should have a folder with the following
        structure:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>📁 studentname.github.io</li>
        <ul>
          <li>📄 index.html</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you did not make it this far, please follow the instructions in
        <a href="/assignment-1/index.html">last week's homework</a> to get to
        the point where you have this folder structure, and have set up your
        Github and Github Pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Note: if you followed these steps last week and are still having
          trouble, first make sure that your repositories visibility is 'Public'
          and not 'Private.'</i
        >
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="./repository-visibility.png"
          alt="Repository on Github.com"
          style="max-height: 500px"
        />
        <figcaption>
          <i>Repository on Github.com with a 'Public' visibility tag.</i>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <i
          >If your repository does not have the text next to it that says
          'Public' like the above image, please follow
          <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#changing-a-repositorys-visibility"
            target="_blank"
            >these instructions</a
          >
          to change your repositories visibility from 'Private' to 'Public.'</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >If you are still having issues, please reach out to me or the CD Code
          Tutors for assistance!</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to organize our projects and webpages logically, so at the top
        level we will add two new Folders, 'Projects' and 'Workshops'
        respectively.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>📁 studentname.github.io</li>
        <ul>
          <li>📁 projects</li>
          <li>📁 workshops</li>
          <li>📄 index.html</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        We want to create the folder for our first assignment, the
        Questionnaire, into the workshop folder. To keep things organized, we
        will make a folder for it, and move our current 'index.html' file into
        that folder.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>📁 studentname.github.io</li>
        <ul>
          <li>📁 projects</li>
          <li>📁 workshops</li>
          <ul>
            <li>📁 workshop-1</li>
            <ul>
              <li>📄 index.html</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        Finally, we will create a new <u>index.html</u> file in the root of our
        folder, this will be the new Homepage.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>📁 studentname.github.io</li>
        <ul>
          <li>📄 index.html</li>
          <li>📁 projects</li>
          <li>📁 workshops</li>
          <ul>
            <li>📁 workshop-1</li>
            <ul>
              <li>📄 index.html</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h4>Absolute and Relative Links</h4>
      <br />
      <h3>Committing New Changes to Git & Github</h3>
      <p>
        When you are ready to update your Github Pages with your new content,
        open the Github Desktop application and navigate to the
        <u>studentname.github.io</u> repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the left hand side, you will see all the files which have had
        changes. You can click any of those files to see what changes have been
        made - any line of text with a red background has been removed, and any
        line of text with a green background has been added.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the Checkboxes next to file names to select which files you want to
        update and upload - most likely, you want to update the entire site so
        leave them all checked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we have selected which changes we want to include, we need to
        describe them. In the lower left-corner you will need to write a summary
        of your changes, and can add an optional description. When complete,
        select "Commit to main" to add these changes and describe the codebases
        current state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, were going to 'Push' our new code from our Local machine to the
        Github Pages repository online so it's public!
      </p>
