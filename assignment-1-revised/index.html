      <h1>Assignment #1 - Github Pages ( Review )</h1>
      <p>
        This week, our main goal is to create our 'Home Page' on Github Pages
        where we will be hosting our future work, projects, and personal
        information. We will update our file structure to allow organizing
        multiple Projects and Workshops on our site which we will then link to
        from the homepage, including your earlier earlier Questionnaire and
        upcoming "Cross-Platform Storytelling" Project.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will also watch a video previewing what we will be working on next
        week in class: using CSS to work with
        <b>Typography on the Web</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would also advise reviewing videos from last week for when you are
        beginning to code your "Cross-Platform Storytelling" projects to refresh
        your memory on <b>HTML and CSS Basics</b>, <b>Embedded Content</b>, and
        <b>Github Pages</b>.
      </p>
      <h2>Due Next Week</h2>
      <ul>

          <u>#assignment-1</u> Slack Channel.

        File Structure and Organization
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you made it far enough last week to create a Github account or a
        Github Pages site, you should have a folder with the following
        structure:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>📁 studentname.github.io</li>
        <ul>
          <li>📄 index.html ( Questionnaire )</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you did not make it this far, please follow the instructions in
        <a href="/assignment-1/index.html">last week's homework</a> to get to
        the point where you have this folder structure, and have set up your
        Github and Github Pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Note: if you followed these steps last week and are still having
          trouble, first make sure that your repositories visibility is 'Public'
          and not 'Private.'</i

      <p>
        We want to organize our projects and webpages logically, so at the top
        level we will add two new Folders, 'Projects' and 'Workshops'
        respectively.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>📁 studentname.github.io</li>
        <ul>
          <li>📁 projects</li>
          <li>📁 workshops</li>
          <li>📄 index.html ( Questionnaire )</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        We want to create the folder for our first assignment, the
        Questionnaire, into the workshop folder. To keep things organized, we
        will make a folder for it, and move our current 'index.html' file into
        that folder.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>📁 studentname.github.io</li>
        <ul>
          <li>📁 projects</li>
          <li>📁 workshops</li>
          <ul>
            <li>📁 workshop-1</li>
            <ul>
              <li>📄 index.html ( Questionnaire )</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        Finally, we will create a new <u>index.html</u> file in the root of our
        folder, this will be the new Homepage.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>📁 studentname.github.io</li>
        <ul>
          <li>📄 index.html ( New Homepage )</li>
          <li>📁 projects</li>
          <li>📁 workshops</li>
          <ul>
            <li>📁 workshop-1</li>
            <ul>
              <li>📄 index.html ( Questionnaire )</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3 id="create-a-homepage">Create Your Homepage</h3>
      <p>
        In your 'Homepage' <u>index.html</u> file, please use the following
        HTML5 template as a starting point for building your homepage ( right
        click to save as an .html file ):
      </p>
      <a href="./template.html" download>template.html</a>
      <p>
        Add a link to your Questionnaire project from the homepage using a
        'relative' link path as we discussed in class, if you need a refresher
        please see:
        <a
          href="https://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/"
          target="_blank"
          >Absolute and Relative Links</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Add some links to other websites you think are interesting using
        'Absolute' links - this could be as basic as linking to our Syllabus on
        my Github Page or to anything else you'd like to share.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, repeat the above process to add your "Cross-Platform
        Storytelling" Studio Project to the repository and link to it from your
        homepage.
      </p>

      <h3 id="new-changes-to-git-and-github">
        Committing New Changes to Git & Github
      </h3>
      <p>
        When you are ready to update your Github Pages with your new content,
        open the Github Desktop application and navigate to the
        <u>studentname.github.io</u> repository.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="./changed-files.png"
          alt="Repository on Github.com"
          style="max-height: 500px"
        />
        <figcaption>
          <i>Files which have been modified in your repository.</i>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        On the left hand side, you will see all the files which have had
        changes. You can click any of those files to see what changes have been
        made - any line of text with a red background has been removed, and any
        line of text with a green background has been added.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the Checkboxes next to file names to select which files you want to
        update and upload - most likely, you want to update the entire site so
        leave them all checked.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="./summary-and-description-of-commit.png"
          alt="Repository on Github.com"
          style="max-height: 500px"
        />
        <figcaption>
          <i>Summary and Description of our changes in this 'Commit'.</i>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Now that we have selected which changes we want to include, we need to
        describe them. In the lower left-corner you will need to write a summary
        of your changes, and can add an optional description. When complete,
        select "Commit to main" to add these changes and describe the codebases
        current state.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img

          <i>Pushing changes from Local Machine to Github and Github Pages.</i>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Finally, were going to 'Push' our new code from our Local machine to the
        Github Pages repository online so it's public!
