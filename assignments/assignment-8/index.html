        <h1>Assignment #8 - User Input and Output: User-Created Lists</h1>
        <p>
            Our homework assignment is to begin practice using event handlers to allow users to interact with your
            websites in more complex ways, including using their mouse, keyboard events, and text inputs.
        </p>
        <p>Before starting, I highly recommend watching the two demonstrations I recorded, <a
                href="https://www.loom.com/share/2e139868ab2f42e3b5684ab4cae2ff37" target="_blank">User Input & Output
                (1)</a> which is an introduction to event listeners as a concept. There is also <a
                href="https://www.loom.com/share/f23860230ef54da6b78e20d48b5f9b74" target="_blank">User
                User Input & Output (2)</a> which uses these techniques to create a basic application.</p>
        <p>For homework, we will be building a website that lets users create their own lists. What kind of list, and
            the presentation, is completely up to you! It could be a 'To Do' list, a list of 'Goals' and 'Dreams', a
            list of favorite bands, arts, or designers. The design of the webpage should emphasize and support the
            concept of the site, thinking about its layout, typography, and color choices.</p>
        <p>The user should be able to use a text input to add items to the list on the page.</p>
        <p>There should be at least one other interaction that takes advantage of other events, such as the mouse
            movement, scrolling, or keyboard events. You could include functional interactions to perhaps remove items
            from the list, or it could be more experimental and change or update the design .</p>
        <p>Here is a very minimal example of a 'To Do' list application: <a href="./demo">To Do List Example</a></p>
