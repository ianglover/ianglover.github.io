        <h1>Assignment #7 - Text Generators ( Continued )</h1>
        <p>Continue working on <a href="/assignments/assignment-7/">Assignment 7: Text Generator</a>, applying feedback
            from one-on-one meetings if you needed additional assistance. If you were able to complete the assignment
            without issue, take time to make sure that your project works responsively across devices and has a design (
            considering layout, typography, and color ) that emphasizes and supports the content from your text
            generator.</p>
        <p>
            In preparation for next week where we will begin working with user input and interactions, review the
            at least the following recorded demonstration on User Input and mouse events such as clicking and scrolling,
            keyboard input, and getting text from forms and inputs.
            <!-- If you have time, I would also advise watching the additional reference
            material. -->
