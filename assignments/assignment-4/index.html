      <h1>Assignment #4 - Album Promotional Website</h1>
      <p>
        Our homework assignment is to review everything we have covered in the
        past six weeks and create a promotional page for an album of your
        choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design and presentation of the page should emphasize and build upon
        the visual qualities of the album and its associated content such as
        music videos, merchandise, or other promotional material.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should include content from the album such as its artwork, music
        videos, and promotional material. It should also include information
        like its tracklisting, record label, release date, credited musicians,
        and anything else that seems important to include. The website
        <a href="https://www.discogs.com" target="_blank">Discogs</a> can be a
        valuable resource for this kind of information, for example see
        <a
          href="https://www.discogs.com/release/14716905-Caroline-Polachek-Pang"
          target="_blank"
          >Caroline Polachek - Pang</a
        >. You could also include upcoming tour dates, and links to merchandise
        or album reviews.
      </p>
      <p>
        The page should use all of the techniques we have learned thus far to
        demonstrate an understanding of HTML & CSS Basics, Typography, CSS
        Layout techniques, and Responsive Design.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>HTML & CSS Basics</h3>
      <p>
        Use the basics of HTML and CSS to lay out your page in a well-organized,
        legible way using the correct
        <a
          href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/semantic-html5-elements/"
          target="_blank"
          >Semantic HTML</a
        >
        for each kind of content. For example, use
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul"
          >List Elements</a
        >
        when listing items and content, and
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements"
          target="_blank"
          >Heading Elements</a
        >
        for section headings.
