      <h1>Assignment #5 - Website as Calendar</h1>
      <p>
        Our homework assignment is to continue working on our 'Website as
        Calendar' projects - take wherever you got to last week and try to (1)
        organize your code so that it's legible and easy to read, (2) add at
        least one additional feature to the design. This could be an additional
        degree of randomization and variation with your current design, or an
        entirely new feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continue to review the Javascript content from last week, as well as
        watching the following videos in the 'Asynchronous Homework' section to
        begin learning about working with dynamic data using "Network Requests"
        requests to get information from Databases and APIs.
